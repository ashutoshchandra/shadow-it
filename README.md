In today's enterprise environments, the rapid adoption of cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications has led to a growing phenomenon known as "Shadow IT" â€” the use of unauthorized software and services without the knowledge or approval of the organization's IT department. While Shadow IT can drive innovation and agility, it also introduces significant risks related to security, compliance, and operational inefficiency. This project explores methods for tracking Shadow IT SaaS applications within enterprises, examining both the challenges and opportunities they present. By implementing proactive tracking and management strategies, organizations can mitigate the risks of Shadow IT while supporting the evolving needs of a digital workforce.
