# shadow-it
Shadow IT is any software, hardware or information technology (IT) resource used on an enterprise network without the IT departmentâ€™s approval, knowledge or oversight.

Unmanaged Shadow IT applications in the cloud pose significant security, compliance, and operational risks to enterprises. These applications operate outside the control of IT and security teams, making it difficult to monitor access, enforce policies, and ensure data protection.
